# Readability Gadgets


## Readability Navigation

Component for manage readability options like dark/light theming, font size, font family type, vertical spacing, column weight.
Selection of one item emits a className you should set on a body or container in order to change and adapt your styles.

## TODO
1. Set settings state as parameter so could accept more or less options.
2. Create a holder component or directive for manage className changes by the navigation.
3. Create a set of basic styles for page or holder.


## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```
